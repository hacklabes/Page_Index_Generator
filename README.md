# Page Index Generator

Index generator used to create the index of all sketchs produced and published in our [HackNights 2016](hacklabes/HackNights_Intro_2016_January) at [FACT](http://fact.co.uk)

Using [Phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) to grab images from the webpages with sketchs made with [p5.js](http://p5js.org/).

The result can be viewed here http://flab.space/
